# TitanP1
Phase 1 of Space mission and landing
Description: Second panel that contains the background and runs the simulation(action listener)
            Within the second panel: 3 buttons, click to run, zoom in and out
            
To run the simulation without the GUI compile the Main class with:
"javac Main.java"
then execute it with
"java Main"
the initial position and angle of the spaceship are already put in.
IMPORTANT:
IN THE ZIP FILE SUBMISSION, THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME PROBLEM WITH IMPORT STATEMENTS, IT DOES NOT RUN FOR SOME MEMBERS.
WE JUST WANTED TO BRING IT TO YOUR ATTENTION, SINCE THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE WITH THE JAR VERSION USED.
IN CASE THE PROBLEM PERSISTS, WE WILL BE RUNNING THE CODE DURING THE PRESENTATION, SO THAT WILL DEMONSTRATE HOW THE CODE RUNS.

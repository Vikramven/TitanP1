    /* Copy pasting an example of how RungeKutta works method wise:
    Processes the shot using the Classical 4th-order Runge-Kutta Method. This method takes four samples of the
     * velocity and acceleration at different time-points in a time-step. To get the next position and velocity, a
     * weighted average of these four samples is calculated and multiplied with a time-step, which is added to the
     * current position.
     *
     * The formulas to calculate these samples are:
     *      k1 = v(t)                               k3 = v(t) + l2 * 1/2 * Δt
     *      l1 = a(p(t), v(t))                      l3 = a(p(t) + k2 * 1/2 * Δt, k3)
     *      k2 = v(t) + l1 * 1/2 * Δt               k4 = v(t) + l3 * Δt
     *      l2 = a(p(t) + k1 * 1/2 * Δt, k2)        l4 = a(p(t) + k2 * Δt, k4)
     * (where p = position, v = velocity, a = acceleration, t = time,
     *      and Δt = step size = change in time from current position)
     *
     * And to calculate the next position and next velocity with these samples, the formulas are:
     *      p(t+Δt) = p(t) + 1/6 * Δt * (k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4)
     *      v(t+Δt) = v(t) + 1/6 * Δt * (l1 + 2*l2 + 2*l3 + l4)
     */
